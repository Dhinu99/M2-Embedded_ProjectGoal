# M2-Embedded_SEVEN-SEGMENT-DISPLAY-DRIVER
A seven-segment display is generally available in a ten-pin package. While eight pins correspond to the eight LEDs, the remaining two pins (at middle) are common and internally shorted. Therefore, when using a microcontroller to operate a seven-segment LED display, 8 pins are required to control individual LEDs in the display, which can be brought down to 4 using a decoder. This number increases as more SSDs are added into the display.
